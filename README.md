# Blackjack Engine
A graphical interface built on top [Jackfish](http://github.com/Pizzascripters/Jackfish), a Blackjack computational engine. The GUI allows users to:
 * Generate strategy tables
 * Analyze the quality of each action (eg. hit, double) in a given situation
 * Play virtual Blackjack with engine assistance
 * Run simulations

## Running
Create a build of this project with `npm run build`.
Otherwise, you can run a local development server with `npm run react-start`.
Once the project is built, you can run the Express / React server with `npm start`. If no port is specified, the server will start on port 3000.
